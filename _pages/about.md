Thank you for visiting my website!

I am now working in Telus. I like reading novels, watching CS2 games and running. I have finished running half marathon! I took my profile picture in 2022 December, at the front of Staples Stadium. 

Feel free to explore different sections in my website, I keep not only my work and projects, but also my life experience, including restaurants, films and trips. Have fun!
